# PackItUpWebsite

PackItUp! is a fictional travel agency. The goal was to use Bootstrap to create a responsive webpage. The requirements that were met for this assignment included an index page (accessed with the PackItUp logo in the upper left hand corner), a page describing all the packages offered, a contact page with their information displayed, a gallery page featuring videos and a slideshow of images, and a feedback form. The website creates a "hamburger" menu as the page gets smaller. The footer is consistent on all pages, with a brief mission statement of the company, address, and quick contact details.
